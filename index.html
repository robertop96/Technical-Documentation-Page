                </header>
                <p>The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).</p>
                <p>The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).</p>
                <p>Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.</p>

                </header>
                <p>Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”).</p>
                <p>If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”. Please have a look at this figure from the specification, explaining the main idea behind the flex layout.</p>

                <p>Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from main-start to main-end) or the cross axis (from cross-start to cross-end).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>main axis</b> – The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction property (see below).</li>
                    <li><b>main-start | main-end</b> – The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.</li>
                    <li><b>main size</b> – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.</li>
                    <li><b>cross axis</b> – The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.</li>
                    <li><b>cross-start | cross-end</b> – Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.</li>
                    <li><b>cross size</b> – The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.</li>

                <p>This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.</p>
                <code>.container {
                    display: flex; /* or inline-flex */}

                </header>
                <p>This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.</p>
                <code>.container {
                    flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;}</code>

                    <li><code>column</code>: same as row but top to bottom</li>

                <p>This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.</p>
                <code>.container {justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe;}</code>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>flex-start (default)</code>: items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.</li>
                    <li><code>flex-end</code>: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.</li>
                    <li><code>start</code>: items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode direction.</li>
                    <li><code>end</code>: items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode direction.</li>
                    <li><code>left</code>: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.</li>
                    <li><code>right</code>: items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.</li>
                    <li><code>center</code>: items are centered along the line</li>
                    <li><code>space-between</code>: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line</li>
                    <li><code>space-around</code>: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.</li>
                    <li><code>space-evenly</code>: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.</li>

                </header>
                <p>This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).</p>
                <code>.container {align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | first baseline | last baseline | start | end | self-start | self-end + ... safe | unsafe;}</code>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>stretch (default)</code>: stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)</li>
                    <li><code>flex-start / start / self-start</code>: items are placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the flex-direction rules or the writing-mode rules.</li>
                    <li><code>flex-end / end / self-end</code>: items are placed at the end of the cross axis. The difference again is subtle and is about respecting flex-direction rules vs. writing-mode rules.</li>
                    <li><code>center</code>: items are centered in the cross-axis</li>
                    <li><code>baseline</code>: items are aligned such as their baselines align</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The safe and unsafe modifier keywords can be used in conjunction with all the rest of these keywords (although note browser support), and deal with helping you prevent aligning elements such that the content becomes inaccessible.</p>

                </header>
                <p>This aligns a flex container’s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.</p>
                <p><b>Note</b>: this property has no effect when there is only one line of flex items.</p>
                <code>.container {align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | stretch | start | end | baseline | first baseline | last baseline + ... safe | unsafe;}</code>

                    <li><code>flex-start / start</code>: items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) flex-start honors the flex-direction while start honors the writing-mode direction.</li>
                    <li><code>flex-end / end</code>: items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) flex-end honors the flex-direction while end honors the writing-mode direction.</li>

                    <li><code>space-between</code>: items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end</li>
                    <li><code>space-around</code>: items evenly distributed with equal space around each line</li>
                    <li><code>space-evenly</code>: items are evenly distributed with equal space around them</li>
